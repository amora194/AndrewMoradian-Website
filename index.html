        <div class="subheading mb-5">EconomicsðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Andrew Moradian and I am currently a freshman at University of California Riverside currently studying Economics. After studying Economics rigorously in high school for two years, I decided that it truly was a genuine interest of mine to pursue a degree at university. I plan on utilizing the degree I obtain in Economics to work as a Financial Risk Analyst or Investment Analyst. Aside from my educational aspirations, other interests I have developed consist of basketball, surfing, and drawing.  <br><br>

        Before attending college, the most crucial experience that actively allowed myself to build character and learn skills that never came up in high school was my job for the City of Placentia. The job I initially applied for was to work as a lifeguard/swim instructor at local pools in Placentia, however as I built more experience at the city there were many other jobs that came with it. After spending 3 years and going into my 4th year with this job, I have become exceedingly capable in both individual and group environments. The first part of this job included lifeguarding, which consisted of monitoring the children that would be swimming at local pools and ensuring they are safe. The second part was the LearnToSwim Program where the lifeguards would have classes of children from ages 4-12 and teach them how to swim. The water safety instructions for the kids was truly imperative in the grasping of a number of skills in life. Teaching the children the various strokes and techniques for swimming came with the responsibility of frequent and thorough communication with the parents. The conversations I would have with parents and my co-workers allowed for my development of adept communication skills. Working in this environment with many different age ranges where I was the teacher significantly improved how I relay information to other people and how to keep them engaged. Essentially, it is a similar concept to how a business would keep customers/clients satisfied, getting them to consistently come back. Additionally, monitoring the pool for hours at a time when there were 50 kids swimming also enhanced my ability to work exhaustively. With having to become comprehensive in work due to the lives being at risk, I naturally developed the tendency to be detail-oriented in other tasks as well.<br><br>

        Other than my job at the city, there were various clubs I enrolled in during high school that built on my skills of time management and meeting deadlines. One of these clubs was referred to as FBLA, Future Business Leaders of America. This club greatly improved my ability to meet deadlines as there would be business presentations 3 times a year to prepare for during the school year. There were no mandatory meetings to study because participants already had their regular classes on top of FBLA. Therefore, most of the studying would have to be done in my free time, and I even sacrificed a couple weekends to prepare and do well at the events. Similarly, I participated in a lot of volunteer work through the Rising Against Cancer Every Day Club (R.A.C.E.). This club involved 24 hour relays where we would assist in cooking and creating activities at a park for cancer survivors. We would commemorate the loss of individuals who couldnâ€™t make it and spend the night at the park in remembrance.
